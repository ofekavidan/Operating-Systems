# Operating-Systems

As a Computer Science Student in the Hebrew University of Jerusalem, I was required to take the Operating Systems course.
This is a course that teaches you about operating systems, hardware and software integration, memory management, threads and scheduling, using C++ as the main language.
It lasted 13 weeks, in which, we've submitted a total of 4 exercises in various fields and topics.
