# Project: Client-Server Communication System

Project Overview

This project implements a Client-Server Communication System using sockets for inter-process communication (IPC). The server listens for incoming client requests, processes the data, and sends responses back to the client. This model is often used in distributed systems to enable network communication between different processes.

Key Features:

Client-Server Architecture: Implements a socket-based communication system where the client sends requests to the server, and the server responds with processed data.

Concurrent Handling: The server can handle multiple client requests, potentially through multi-threading or asynchronous I/O (depending on your implementation).

Message Exchange: Efficient exchange of messages between the client and server over network sockets.
