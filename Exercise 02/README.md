# OS Exercise 2: Performance Measurement and Virtualization Overhead

Project Overview

This project investigates the performance overhead introduced by virtualization techniques. Specifically, we measure the execution time for various operations in three different environments:

Native Linux

Virtual Machine (VM)

Container

The operations measured include:

A basic mathematical operation (addition).

An empty function call.

A system call (syscall).

By comparing the performance of these operations across the different environments, the project highlights the overhead introduced by virtualization and containerization, which is essential for optimizing systems that utilize these technologies.
