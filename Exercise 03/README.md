# Project: MapReduce Framework with Barrier Synchronization

Project Overview

This project implements a MapReduce Framework designed to handle parallel computing tasks using a barrier synchronization mechanism. The framework distributes work across multiple threads, ensuring that each phase (map and reduce) is completed before proceeding to the next, thanks to the barrier mechanism.


Key Components:

MapReduce Framework: This framework distributes tasks across worker threads for the map and reduce operations.

Barrier Synchronization: Ensures that threads wait until all have completed their current phase before moving forward, maintaining synchronization between threads.

Concurrency: The project utilizes multithreading techniques to handle concurrent map and reduce operations, improving efficiency in processing large datasets.
