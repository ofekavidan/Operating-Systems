# Project: Virtual Memory Management System
Project Overview

This project implements a Virtual Memory Management System designed to simulate the interaction between a process and the memory management unit of an operating system. The goal of the project is to manage virtual memory efficiently, handling page faults, and managing access to pages stored in memory and on disk.

Key Features:

Page Fault Handling: Simulates how the system handles missing pages and retrieves them from secondary storage.

Memory Access Management: Ensures efficient management of memory by simulating memory access patterns.

Swapping: Pages are swapped between physical memory and virtual memory as needed.
